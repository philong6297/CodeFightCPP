There are 3 tasks when you join [Head to Head](https://codefights.com/head-to-head) mode in CodeFight:

* Task 1: Bugfix

* Task 3: Code Writing

So I will give solutions for:

* Task 1 & Task 2 in folder [BugFix and Recovery](https://github.com/philong6297/CodeFightCPP/tree/master/Head%20to%20Head/BugFix%20%26%20Recovery)
* Task 3 in folder [Code Writing](https://github.com/philong6297/CodeFightCPP/tree/master/Head%20to%20Head/Code%20Writing)
